Game Idea
- I want to make a survival game where our protagonist needs to survive the zombie apocalypse.

Scenario and characters description
- We could be in a building where its the last line of defense. This building is actually a military base.
- We could have several characters to choose from where each one of them has a special power.

Characters' actions and goals
-The goals are to survive and collect resources to get upgrades for new weapons and powers from the military base.
-They will be killing the zombies non stop until they get enough resources to get upgrades 
 and progress in the game until they meet the final boss.

Game Win/Lose conditions
-You win the game when you beat the final boss.
-You lose the game if you die before getting to the boss.

Progressions levels
-We could have 10 levels where at the 10th level we have the final boss and at the 5th level we have the miniboss.
-Each level will be a wave type of stages. Each time, the waves will be increasingly harder.

Sources of inspiration
-Any and every zombie movie/series out there. (ZNation, The Walking Dead)
-Call of Duty Zombies (Mostly)

Skills/Interest I am looking for in a teammate
-I want you to be able to adapt. 
-If somethings/ideas change I want you to be able to adapt to any situation.
